## F.A.Q.
### When I install the repository from ZIP file, XBMC complains that it "does not have the correct structure".
This has typically meant that you have downloaded this github repository as a ZIP file (by clicking on the
'Download as zip' button) in the downloads page. Instead, you need to download the repository from the link
in the 'Download Packages' section of the downloads page.
